# Notes
This project involved improving the legacy code from a hypnotical e-commerce website using a LAMP( Linux, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP). We reviewed all the files and learned how they interact in this application. We changed the product from books to stickers and I built a new database to correspond with the new product. I also add an order confirmation receipt for the customer after a purchase was made. I will not add new features to this application as I plan to continue working on new projects.
